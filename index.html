    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Karen Shea and I live in Chicago. I am 28 and currently work in data operations for Grubhub. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, reading, and baking. Before working at Grubhub, I had a few different careers. 
            I worked as a pastry cook, a cheesemonger, and as a working student on a horse farm. I am a middle child with two older sisters and a younger brother and I am a Virgo. I love organizing and making sure everything is in its place.
