    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Karen Shea and I live in Chicago. I am 28 and currently work in data operations for Grubhub. Before working at Grubhub, I had a few different careers. 
            I worked as a pastry cook, a cheesemonger, and as a working student on a horse farm. I am a middle child with two older sisters and a younger brother and I am a Virgo. I love organizing and making sure everything is in its place.

            Additionally, I enjoy running and spending time outdoors. I would rather run outside in the snow than on a treadmill. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, baking, and reading. While I no longer work in a professional kitchen, cooking and baking are relaxing pasttimes but a lot of my friends find it hard to bake or cook with me as I have kept a lot of my professional training.
